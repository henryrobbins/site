Hello! I'm Henry. I'm a Founding Engineer at [Saddlepoint Labs](https://saddlepointlabs.com/). We're building AI tools for wetlabs. I'm currently focused on developing a computer-vision-powered AI pipetting assistant.

Before that, I was an Applied Scientist on Uber's Shared Rides team where I worked on waiting dynamics and Scheduled Shared Rides.

During my undergraduate years, I helped develop [Cornell's COVID-19 response](https://henryrobbins.com/experiences/cornell-covid-response/). With a small team, I redesigned the course roster and made recommendations for return-to-campus testing policies.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading about computational creativity, making
images, and seeing as much live music as I can.
