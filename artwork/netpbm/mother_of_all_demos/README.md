This work is based off of the [Highlights of the 1968 "Mother of All
Demos"](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCGFadV4FqU2yAqCzKaxnKKXgnJBUrKTE)
given by Doug Engelbart. It was the "world debut of personal and interactive
computing". The playlist consists of 10 parts. From each video, the part
number, view count, likes, and dislikes were recorded. These numbers were then
converted into binary. The first four (4) columns of the piece encode the part
number from 1 to 10. The next seventeen (17) columns encode the view count. The
remaining eight (8) and two (2) columns encode the likes and dislikes
respectively.
