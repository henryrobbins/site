In mathematics, the Drunkard's walk most often refers to a point in the
euclidean plane iteratively moving in a random cardinal direction. This work is
generated via a Drunkard's walk. In each image, the grid depicts 9 different
walks of the same length. Whenever the "drunk" visits a pixel, that pixel is
"eroded" by the pixel becoming whiter.
