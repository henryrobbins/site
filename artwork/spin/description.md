`spin.sh` and `spin.py` are a Bash and Python script respectively which return
a spinning bar rotating every t seconds where t is an argument to both scripts.
The bar will rotate until CRTL+C is pressed. An example call for both scripts
is given below.

```
# display a spinning bar rotating every 0.1 seconds
bash spin.sh 0.1
python spin.py 0.1
```
