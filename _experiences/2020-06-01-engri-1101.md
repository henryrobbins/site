*ENGRI 1101: Engineering Applications of Operations Research* is a freshman
level course conceived by [David Shmoys][dbs]. It has been taught at Cornell
University for over two decades. The following description of the course was
taken from the [Spring 2022 Class Roster][roster].

> Introduction to the problems and methods of operations research and
> information engineering focusing on problem areas (including inventory,
> network design, and resource allocation), the situations in which these
> problems arise, and several standard solution techniques. In the
> computational laboratory, students encounter problem simulations and use some
> standard commercial software packages.

Like many, my decision to major in operations research was a direct result of
taking the class freshman year (Fall 2018). One of the topics that intrigued me
most was [linear][lp] and [integer][ip] programming. The class teaches the
[simplex method][simplex] for solving linear programs and [branch and
bound][bnb] for solving integer programs. Having geometric intuition for these
algorithms was crucial to my understanding however, I found current
visualization tools lacking. This motivated me to join a team led by [David
Shmoys][dbs] in Summer 2020 that was initiating a revamp of the course.

The majority of my Summer 2020 work was spent developing [GILP][gilp], a Python
package for visualizing the simplex and branch and bound algorithms. I took the
following Fall 2020 semester off while I worked full-time on course development
and acted as a teaching assistant. During that time, I implemented [Jupyter
Notebook][jupyter] versions of many old labs and created substantial new lab
material. Additionally, I standardized all lab content in preparation for
publishing an online textbook. In January 2021, I developed [vinal][vinal], a
Python package to visualize graph algorithms for the [TSP][tsp], shortest path
problem, and [MST][mst] problem.

I took a sideline role until Spring 2022 when I returned as a teaching
assistant for a second semester. In preparation for another summer of students
developing lab material, I gathered all of the pieces from Summer 2021 and
revamped the organization of lab material. Unable to help myself, I rejoined
the team. During Summer 2022, my work was mainly focused on integrating lab
material with a new software platform for the future delivery on eCornell. In
addition, I advised on a platform for hosting an online interactive textbook.
My final task was publicizing the past two years of work in a new GitHub
Organization for the course.
