vinal is a Python package for visualizing graph/network algorithms. Currently, the following algorithms are implemented:

- [Shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem)
    - [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- [Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
    - [Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
    - [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
    - [Reverse Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-delete_algorithm)
- [Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
    - Random neighbor
    - [Nearest neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbour_algorithm)
    - Nearest insertion
    - Furthest insertion
    - [2-OPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-opt)

[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graphs can be constructed from a single ```.csv``` file of node locations. Alternatively, one can specify edges of the graph by providing an additional ```.csv``` file of edges. The package relies on [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) to generate standalone HTML files which can be viewed in a Jupyter Notebook inline or in a web browser.
