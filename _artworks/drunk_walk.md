In mathematics, the Drunkard's walk most often refers to a point in 2D space
iteratively moving in a random cardinal direction. This work is generated via a
Drunkard's walk. In each image, the grid depicts 9 different walks of the same
length. Whenever the "drunk" visits a pixel, that pixel is eroded signified by
the pixel becoming whiter.
