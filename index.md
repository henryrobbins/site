I am a Cornell Engineering student ('22) studying Operations Research and Computer
Science. In Summer 2021, I was a Data Science Intern on Uber's Matching and
Shared Rides team where I developed and implemented an algorithm for
pre-scheduled rides. Prior to that, I developed materials for the forthcoming
book, Data Science and Decision Making: An Elementary Introduction to Modeling
and Optimization. In August 2020, I took a break from that work to aid Cornell
in providing in person instruction under the restrictions of COVID-19. My
contributions included re-optimizing course schedules and formulating a
mathematical model to schedule and assign rooms for exams. You can read more
about the effort in
[this short article](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/spotlights/unsung-engineering-behind-cornells-fall-2020-schedule).

My broad research interests lie in studying applied combinatorial optimization
problems with computational components. My coursework has focused on the topics
of discrete optimization and algorithms. I also enjoy studying how these
topics can be used in imagemaking.

Outside of my studies, I am a co-captain of the Cornell Men's Squash Team and an
Umphreak looking forward to the next show.
