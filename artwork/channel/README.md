Netpbm (P3)

This work was generated using code adapted from Dan Torop. His script separates
pixels of a P3 Netpbm image into the three color channels allowing each color
channel to be modified independently. I further generalized this script by
allowing for an anonymous function to be passed for each channel. The current
pieces explore the application of the sin, ceiling, and triangle wave functions.
