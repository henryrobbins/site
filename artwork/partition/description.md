In bringing digital images to life, photographer [Richard
Benson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Benson_(photographer))
"partitioned" the image allowing for finer control on independent parts of the
image.  This image transformation technique is based on
this idea. Each column corresponds to a different gradient in the image. The
first two rows highlight pixels of the corresponding gradient in white and
black respectively. The next two rows highlight the pixels and background in
the color of the corresponding gradient.
