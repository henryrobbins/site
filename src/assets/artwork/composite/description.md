Like the weierstrass series, this work explores the result of substituting
carefully chosen parameters in image transformation algorithms with unbased
choices. Here, arbitrary functions are used in the compositing of both the
color and alpha (opacity) components of an image. This is referred to as
[alpha compositing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing).
