Inspired by [Dinh Q. Lê](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinh_Q._Lê)'s handwoven
photographs, *weave* is an exercise in digital image compositing. *weave*
explores the notion of a meta-algorithm generating an image through an
iterative process guided by errors in implementation. Note Brian Eno's [Oblique
Strategy](https://www.oblique-strategies.com/): "Honor thy error as a hidden
intention."
