simpar (SIMulate PAndemic Response) simulates the spread of a disease through a
heterogeneous population using an [SIR model][1].
The `groups` module can be used to manage a heterogeneous population comprised
of "meta-groups" with varying contact levels. The tool focuses on providing
functionality for assessing pandemic response strategies such as isolation
protocols, testing regimes (with varying tests), and vaccination requirements.
The `Strategy` class is used to define a potential strategy. The `Scenario`
class is used to manage the parameters pertaining to a scenario under which a
disease is spreading. This consists of a population, environment parameters
(e.g. outside rate of infection), and disease parameters (e.g. symptomatic
rate). Lastly, the `Trajectory` class offers methods to compute metrics on a
simulation of some strategy applied to a scenario. For more details,
see the [Documentation][2].
