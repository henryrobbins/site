ASCII and PNG

This work uses a particular style of [ASCII
art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art) in which "symbols with various
intensities [are used for] creating gradients or contrasts." A custom process
for converting images to ASCII was applied to the Grateful Dead Steal Your Face
Logo.
