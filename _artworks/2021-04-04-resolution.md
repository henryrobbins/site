The images paper and florida were photographed by River Chavez.

This work aims to draw a strong connection between properties of a source image
and the pixels used to represent it. A rule was devised to delegate a
resolution reliant on the brightness an image. The image was gridded and the
resolution of each section was adjusted according to this rule. The script used
to carry out this procedure was designed for a black and white image.  In
`florida_resolution.ppm`, this script was applied to a color image resulting in
various anomalies which were embraced.
