GILP (Geometric Interpretation of Linear Programs) is a Python package for
visualizing the geometry of:

- [Linear Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) (LPs)
- [The Simplex Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm)
- [The Branch and Bound Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound)

LPs can be constructed from NumPy arrays and many examples
(such as the [Klee-Minty cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klee%E2%80%93Minty_cube))
are included. The revised simplex method is implemented along with phase I for finding
an initial feasible solution. The package relies on [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
to generate standalone HTML files which can be viewed in a Jupyter Notebook
inline or in a web browser.
