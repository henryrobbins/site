[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
is a classic example of complex "emergent" behavior stemming from seemingly
simple rules. In this work, Conway's Game of Life was seeded from a source
image and evolved until a stable state was reached. The resulting animation was
then overlaid on top of the original source image.
