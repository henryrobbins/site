The images sky (2021-02-24), faces (2021-03-07), and stomp (2021-03-07)
were photographed by Ella Clemons.

This work focuses on a particular image transformation technique: taking the
mod of an image. Here, 'taking an image mod k' refers to taking the value of
every pixel mod k to create the transformed image. In addition to stills, this
work also includes an animation consiting of the image mod k for k in [1..150].
