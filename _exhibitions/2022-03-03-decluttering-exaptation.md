# decluttering, exaptation (2022)

*"Featuring work created by Khaly Durst and Henry Robbins, "decluttering,
exaptation" explores the limits of digital image-making through the creation
of new tools and workflows. With the use of
[dmtools](https://dmtools.henryrobbins.com/en/latest/), a software developed
by Henry Robbins, both artists work towards destructing the digital image
through the use of their own workflows and code."*

The exhibition features work created by both artists to explore the limits of
digital image-making through the creation of new tools and the breaking of
current ones. The use of algorithms in both image generation and manipulation
plays a central role. Algorithms are devised to transform images and existing
algorithms are exploited through their unconventional use. The work, though at
times appearing chaotic, is the direct result of choices by the artist. In many
cases, these choices include the choice of an input image, an algorithm, and
input parameters to that algorithm. This mode of artistic expression is
analogous to that of the electronic musician who faces similar choices in how
an input sound will be transformed before reaching its final state.

The concurrent development of software and the derivation of artistic work
using said software brings on questions about the nature of artistic process.
Decisions often arise in which the “right” step forward from a software
development lens is in opposition with the “right” step forward from an
artistic lens. To solely make decisions via either lens would be inauthentic
to the work. The development of the tool is driven by the desires of the artist
allowing them to realize actions that were impossible or tedious with current
tools.

The work presented utilizes a software called
[dmtools](https://dmtools.henryrobbins.com/en/latest/) which began development
in Spring 2021 during *ART 3699: Images and Algorithms*, taught by Assistant
Professor [Dan Torop](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/dan-torop). The software
continued to be developed in a collaborative effort by both artists as part of
the "Image Toolmaking Lab" which is part of [AAP's](https://aap.cornell.edu)
new program of research labs. The exhibit hopes to spread awareness of the
possibilities this software offers as an artistic medium.
